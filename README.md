# Ticket-Exchange-Sentiment-Analysis
The aim of this analysis is to shed light on the following question: What is the experience like for BTS fans trading concert tickets on Twitter?

I was curious about exploring this question as a member of the BTS fandom. Due to overwhelming demand for BTS concert tickets, some fans who are unable to secure concert tickets during the pre-sale and general onsale, turn to social media to locate affordable fan-to-fan tickets for sale and/or trading. However, while there are some advantages to this method (potential for better prices, no re-sale tickets fees, community building), it can also be prone to fans being targeted by scammers and/or being taken advantage of.

Thus, I wanted to run a text sentiment classifier on tweets from a BTS concert tickets Twitter trading account to see if a sentiment classifier would be able to detect ticket scamming activity. I chose to use VADER sentiment analyzer for this inquiry since I am analyzing text data from Twitter and this model has been trained on social media text. I used Twitter API to obtain the text data from the analyzed Twitter account. Due to API access restrictions, I set up the tweet count to 200 (to round up) since I was only able to access 197 tweets at time. 

I first ran a few test to get a sense of how the VADER classifier was evaluating the sentiments. The first two texts are just generic sentences and the last three are more specific to ticket scamming. As excepted, the classifier was able to detect both positive and negative tones of the first couple of tests. However, it didn't perform as well with the scam-specific sentences. Particularly, I tested a very common phrase to alert account users of a scammer: "Scammer alert". Unfortunately, the classifier didn't detect this sentence as negative (compound score: 0.296), suggesting that the classifier would underestimate the amount of negative tweets in reference to scams. I tested two other scam-related sentences: "Ticket scam", and "I got scammed". The classifier was able to detect the former as negative, but misclassified the latter as neutral, again suggesting that the negative tweets in relation to scams may be underestimated. Still, according to the threshold method selected for this analysis (more on this in the next paragraph), the classifier misclassified two of these as neutral and not positive, which at least provides some anecdotal evidence that the model is not classifying scam-related tweets as positive.

I used the compound score to classify tweets as positive, negative, or neutral. The compound score is how the model measures overall sentiment and it uses a scale from -1 to 1. The closer a score is to -1, the more negative the classified text is considered. Similarly, the closer a score is to 1, the more positive the classified text is considered. To use a prediction selection method that evenly splits the range of values, I used the thresholds of -0.333 and 0.333. Specifically, I predicted texts as negative if the compound score was less than or equal to -0.333, neutral if the compound score was between -0.333 and 0.333, and positive if the compound score was greater than or equal to 0.333.

The results are displayed in a pie chart generated with Matplotlib. Current results are as follows: 31.0% positive, 61.9% neutral, and 7.1% negative. While a relatively low percentage of tweets were classified as negative, results seem inconclusive since there is a large percent of tweets that were classified as neutral, potentially having included many "Scammer alert" and "I got scammed" type of tweets, incorrectly placing them in the neutral category as indicated by the earlier test. To improve results, perhaps a sentiment classifier that is trained with concert ticket specific social media text data is needed.
 
In general, the classifier didn't find any evidence of widespread scamming activity as measured by tweets classified as negative, but again, misclassification of tweets may have been the reason. In any case, fans using social media to buy/sell/trade concert tickets should still proceed with caution.
